== Guidelines for New User == 

After downloading the zip file, unzip to your thumb drive and run !GameAnywhere.exe from your thumb drive and vice versa. This would enable you to synchronize your game data to your thumb drive. If you are purely doing online synchronization of your game data, you can run the program from your computer. 

You can store your game files on your free GameAnywhere Online Account. [UserGuide#Registering_for_your_Online_Account Registration] of an account is free.

To keep your !GameAnywhere online game files synchronized with your thumb drive, simply do a web and thumb synchronization.

Please note that although the online storage space is unlimited for each user on our server (Amazon S3), synchronization of very large game files will take a substantial amount of time as there is a cap on the upload/download bandwidth of each user. However, synchronizing configuration game files is fast as they are smaller in size.

We would like to advise you that although storage space is unlimited for each user on our server, synchronization of very large game files e.g. The Sims 3, Football Manager 2009, Football Manager 2010, Dragon Age Origins will take a substantial amount of time as there is a cap on the upload/download bandwidth of each user. Uploading/downloading configuration game files would be very fast as they are not too big in size.

To uninstall, simply remove all file that was unzip from !GameAnywhere.zip. For !GameAnywhere to function normally, please do not tamper with the files/folders contained in the !GameAnywhere folder.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

*Q Why is the program not detecting my game files? Why am I not able to load my saved games after a successful synchronization?

A. If you are running under windows Vista/7, please make sure that you run the game under proper User Account Control rights. If the game requires administrator access to write to the folder and you are running the game under a normal user account, your game files are actually kept in Users\username\AppData\Local\VirtualStore, which will not be detected by our program. Fortunately, this happens only with a minority of the games we support as most games do not store the game files in the install directory anymore, due to User Account Control rights issues.

*Q Why does the program inform me that it cannot send activation e-mail to me?

A. Your firewall is most likely blocking our program from sending. Please reconfigure your firewall settings to allow our program to send. 

*Q. Why are there synchronization errors?*

A. There can be many different reasons. The game file might be in use, locked or missing. Please follow the course of action that the program advises should an error occur.

*Q. How can I ensure that synchronization errors do not occur?*

A. Close your running games and open folder windows before you do a synchronization and do not tamper with the game files on both the computer and thumb drive on your own.

*Q. Is there a possibility that the restoration of a computer to its original state can fail?*

A. The likelihood is slim but it is possible. Please follow the on-screen instructions should a restoration fail.

*Q. I don't understand why the program can never restore my files even though I have synchronized successfully to the computer.

A. Windows has a very inconsistent file locking mechanism. To ensure that your synchronization and restoration are always smooth, make sure that the game folder (usually located at C:\Program Files) is not locked i.e. you do not require administrator permission to access it.
