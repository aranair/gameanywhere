#summary How to extend the list of supported games.

= Steps to follow to add more game support =

 # Create method to use registry entry to check existence of the new game.
 # Create a new instance of Game object.
 # Edit the appropriate information for the Game to work:
{{{
- configList = The list of paths to the configuration folders or files of the game.
- saveList   = The list of paths to the saved game folders or files of the game.
- configParentPath = the folder in which all the config files/folders are in.
- gameName = The name of the game.
- install path = The install path of the game ( found in the registry )

- Private helper methods have been made to find the documents path, the type of OS of user, registry software path, program files path to aid in finding generic paths for all 3 OS:
  windows xp, windows vista, and windows 7.
- Methods to edit the configList and savedGameList are preferably seperated because of step 4.
}}}
 # For the sync direction of external to computer, EditConfigAndSavedGameLists() function is to be editted to support the new game as well. Each new game instance in the common list between the external and the computer, upon finding that the thumbdrive has the appropriate folders for the synchronization, MUST be initialized with config/savedList containing the paths to the files in the external thumbdrive instead of paths to the computer's files. 
 # You're set to synchronize. If you would like to add icons to your game in the program, you would have to edit the GUI class to load your icons as well.
