SyncAction contains the necessary information to sync a game. Each game would be wrapped in a SyncAction object. The game files to be sync and the files that were unsuccessfully synced are contained in this class. Initially, it contains an empty list of SyncError when it is created by the GUI. Only after OfflineSync processes the SyncAction then would the list of SyncError be filled.

There are basically two types of games files that can be sync, saved games files and game configuration files. User can choose to sync either one or both.
