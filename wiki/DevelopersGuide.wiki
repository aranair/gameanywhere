This diagram depicts what happens in the program. The Controller is declared and the Controller starts up the GUI.
The GUI interacts with the user. In a typical synchronization scenario, the user indicates the direction of the
synchronization first. The GUI will request information regarding the games from Controller, which in turn calls
GameLibrary for the information to return to GUI. After the user selects the games to syncrhonize, GUI will then create a list of SyncAction with the games'
information and send to Controller for synchronization. Controller will then provide the information
to OfflineSync class to process.


SyncError is a class to store the various aspects of a synchronization error. Game is a class to store the information
regarding a Game. GameLibrary contains lists of Games. SyncAction initially contains an empty list of SyncErrors when it is created by the GUI. Only
after OfflineSync processes the SyncActions then would the list of SyncErrors be filled.
