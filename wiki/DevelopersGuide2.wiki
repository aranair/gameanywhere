*Welcome to !GameAnywhere.*

!GameAnywhere is a file synchronization software that enables gamers to bypass the hassle on reconfiguring game settings and easily have their saved game data with them anywhere, anytime.

<wiki:toc max_depth="2" />

----

= Getting Started =

In this section, we would introduce the basic features of !GameAnywhere and what you will need to develop !GameAnywhere.

== Software Requirements ==
  * Windows operating system, XP and above.
  * .Net 3.5 framework installed.


== Features of !GameAnywhere==

 * Synchronize game files between thumb drive and computer or vice versa with just a few clicks with our intuitive graphical user interface.


 * Automatically detect the games installed on the computer and offer you the appropriate synchronization options.


 * Restore the computer to its original state after you're done playing on the computer with the files you have synchronized.


 * Supports World of Warcraft, Warcraft 3, FIFA 10 and Football Manager 2010. 

 * No installation needed.

= Software Architecture =

In this section, we would give you a high level overview of the components in !GameAnywhere.

http://lh4.ggpht.com/_-Xzk-2Bdr-I/S5-iBOIsmBI/AAAAAAAAAKg/pl0IsI3zVG8/highleveldiagram.JPG
This diagram depicts what happens in the program. 

The Controller is declared and the Controller starts up the GUI. The GUI interacts with the user. 

In a typical synchronization scenario, the user indicates the direction of the synchronization first. The GUI will request information regarding the games from Controller, which in turn calls GameLibrary for the information to return to GUI. 

After the user selects the games to synchronize, GUI will then create a list of SyncAction with the games' information and send it to Controller for synchronization. Controller will then provide the information to OfflineSync class to process.

= Software Data Structure = 

This section describes the various classes that were used to store information.


{{{
== Data Class name ==

<Class diagram>

//Description, what data is stored and what are the data used for

  * //Class that uses this data structure

}}}

== Game ==

{{{
<Class diagram>
}}}

Game is a class to store the information regarding a Game. 

=== See Also === 
  * [DevelopersGuide2#GameLibrary_Class GameLibrary Class]



== Sync Error ==

{{{
<Class diagram>
}}}

SyncError stores all the information for an synchronization error. It would contain the unsuccessful sync file/folder path, the process that encountered this error and lastly, the error message.

=== See Also ===
  * [DevelopersGuide2#OfflineSync_Class OfflineSync Class]



== Sync Action ==

{{{
<Class diagram>
}}}

SyncAction contains the necessary information to sync a game. Each game would be wrapped in a SyncAction object. The game files to be sync and the files that were unsuccessfully synced are contained in this class. Initially, it contains an empty list of SyncError when it is created by the GUI. Only after OfflineSync processes the SyncAction then would the list of SyncError be filled.

There are basically two types of games files that can be sync, saved games files and game configuration files. User can choose to sync either one or both.

= Class Summary = 

== !GameLibrary Class ==

The GameLibrary class, contains all the methods and information to initialize installed games into a list of games, that will contain all the appropriate paths to the config files and saved game files of each individual game.

It will also resolve and return the common set of games that are found in both the source and target paths according to the synchronization direction
chosen by the user, through the method GetGameList(direction). The direction of synchronization must be properly defined with this method.


== !OfflineSync Class ==
This class handles the file/folder manipulation on the computer as well as on the external storage device. The sync direction determine how the game files are transferred. 

=== See Aslo ===

= Game Files Storage Structure =

In !GameAnywhere, we are concern about two types of game files. They are *Configuration* files and *Saved Game* files. 

Games files on the computer are detected automatically (see [DevelopersGuide2#Games_Detection Games Detection]). 

This is how game files stored on the external device:

A general structure looks like this:
  * !GameAnywhere.exe
  * SyncFolder
    * Game 1
      * config
      * savedGame
    * Game 2
      * config
    * ...


*Example:* 

http://lh3.ggpht.com/_SHs8HAxHUn8/S7F72aDQyFI/AAAAAAAADdc/gk5z_q7FO6E/Folder%20structure.JPG

Use camel case for folder names i.e. "savedGame". 

== !SyncFolder ==

!GameAnywhere would create a folder to store all the games files that you would want to save. This folder is called *syncFolder*. It would be located at the same directory as !GameAnywhere.exe.

The subfolders in *syncFolder* are the game folder(s). Each of the game folder is named after a game. 

Configuration and Saved game files are store in their respective folder under a game folder.

= Adding Games =

This is how to extend the list of supported games.

== Steps to follow to add more game support ==

 # Create method to use registry entry to check existence of the new game.
 # Create a new instance of Game object.
 # Edit the appropriate information for the Game to work:
{{{
- configList = The list of paths to the configuration folders or files of the game.
- saveList   = The list of paths to the saved game folders or files of the game.
- configParentPath = the folder in which all the config files/folders are in.
- gameName = The name of the game.
- install path = The install path of the game ( found in the registry )

- Private helper methods have been made to find the documents path, the type of OS of user, registry software path, program files path to aid in finding generic paths for all 3 OS:
  windows xp, windows vista, and windows 7.
- Methods to edit the configList and savedGameList are preferably seperated because of step 4.
}}}
 # For the sync direction of external to computer, EditConfigAndSavedGameLists() function is to be editted to support the new game as well. Each new game instance in the common list between the external and the computer, upon finding that the thumbdrive has the appropriate folders for the synchronization, MUST be initialized with config/savedList containing the paths to the files in the external thumbdrive instead of paths to the computer's files. 
 # You're set to synchronize. If you would like to add icons to your game in the program, you would have to edit the GUI class to load your icons as well.

-----

= Offline Synchronization =

Offline synchronization includes synchronizing between the computer and the [DevelopersGuide2#SyncFolder SyncFolder]. [DevelopersGuide2#SyncFolder SyncFolder] is located on an external device.

== External Device to Computer Sync == 

*Steps for synchronizing from External storage device to Computer:*
 # Create a backup folder in the game file parent directory.
   * If backup folder exists, skip backup process.
 # Move original game files in the computer into the backup folder to complete backup process.
   * If backup is not successful, skip sync for game.
 # Copy the game files in the external storage device into the computer.


== Computer to External Device Sync ==

*Steps for synchronizing from Computer to External storage device:*
 # Remove existing game files in external storage device.
 # Create the necessary game folder structure in the external storage device.
 # Copy game files from computer into the new directory.


== Restore Computer to Original Game State ==

*Steps for restore:*
 # Remove game files on computer.
 # Move game files from backup folder into it's original directory.
 # Remove backup folder.
